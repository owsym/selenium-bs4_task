You should write a python program which should be able to scroll a youtube channel webpage all the way to then end. For example, we have this channel of my teacher https://www.youtube.com/@zusmani78/videos. Your code should be able to go to this page and automatically scroll down until you reach the end of the page.
Once you have reached the end of the page, you should scrape the information of all the videos present on that page and nicely store that in a CSV file using pandas. The output CSV file should have record of these four fields of video: name, views, duration, time
Once you have done the above two tasks, write a general program which should take the input of a youtube channel link, which then outputs a record of all the videos uploaded by that channel.
